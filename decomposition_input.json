// TODO Should it perhaps be file-based instead of class-based? Should we have paths for each class as there might be classes with the same name?
// Use Package + classname? Or is that also not a unique identifier?
// TODO It might be nice to mention the references here automactically, though perhaps this is not required as we can automatically identify them  with code analysis.
// With that I mean the method invocations.

// If classes are not mentioned, we can expect them to stay where they are (perhaps some monolithic module)
