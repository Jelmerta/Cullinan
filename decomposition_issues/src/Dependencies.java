// What should happen if two separate modules both have a dependency on a piece of code?
// For example, if multiple services want to send an email, they may want to rely on
// a dependency like import MailManager;
// To make sure the dependency is available to two different services, without these services relying on each other for the dependency,
// a common module can be introduced that contains dependencies that are shared between services.
// It might be the case that the code can be rewritten such that this dependency is not needed at all, such as through an event bus, but that is up to the developers how they want to manage this.
